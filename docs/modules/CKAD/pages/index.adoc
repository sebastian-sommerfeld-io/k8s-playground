= Certified Kubernetes Application Developer

The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) program has been developed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), in collaboration with The Linux Foundation, to help expand the Kubernetes ecosystem through standardized training and certification.

*Who Is It For:* This certification is for Kubernetes engineers, cloud engineers and other IT professionals responsible for building, deploying, and configuring cloud native applications with Kubernetes.

*About This Certification:* CKAD has been developed by The Linux Foundation and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), to help expand the Kubernetes ecosystem through standardized training and certification. This exam is an online, proctored, performance-based test that consists of a set of performance-based tasks (problems) to be solved in a command line.

*What It Demonstrates:* The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) can design, build and deploy cloud-native applications for Kubernetes. A CKAD can define application resources and use Kubernetes core primitives to create/migrate, configure, expose and observe scalable applications.
The exam assumes working knowledge of container runtimes and microservice architecture. The successful candidate will be comfortable (1) working with (OCI-compliant) container images, (2) applying Cloud Native application concepts and architectures and (3) working with and validating Kubernetes resource definitions.

== Udemy Section 1: Course Content and Introduction
The CKAD test to obtain the cert is a hands-on practical exam. So it is important to practice what you learn. So make use of the browser-lab which accompanies the Udemy course.


== Udemy Section 2: Core Concepts
=== Kubernetes Architecture
. Node = Machine (physical or virtual) = Worker Node = The place where containers run
. Cluster = Set of nodes
. Master = Node which is configured as a Master -> responsible for the orchestration of containers on the actual worker nodes

When installing kubernetes, the following *components* are installed

. API Server -> Frontend for Kubernetes (Users, CLI, management devices all talk to the API server to interact with the cluser)
. `etcd` (Service) -> Distributed key-value store (stores information from all nodes and all worker nodes in a distributed way)
. `kubelet` (Service) -> The agent running on each node on the cluster and makes sure the containers are running on the nodes as expected.
. Container Runtime -> Underlying softwar to run containers (e.g. Docker)
. Controller -> The brain behind orchestration. Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes, containers or endpoints go down. Controllers make decisions on bringing up new containers.
. Scheduler -> Distributing work / containers accross multiple nodes (looks for newly created containers and assigns them to nodes)

==== How does one server become a master and another one a worker?
Worker nodes come with a container runtime. Master nodes are not intended to run containers. They only control the cluster.

All information gathered from the `kube-apiserver` and the `kubelet` instances are stored in `etcd` on the master.

==== `kubectl`
Kubernetes provides a command line tool for communicating with a Kubernetes cluster's control plane, using the Kubernetes API. This tool is named `kubectl`.

Used to deploy and manage application on akubernetes cluster, to get information on the cluster and cluster nodes and many other things.

==== Master Node vs Control Plane
*Is Kubernetes control plane the same as the master node?* -> A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes, which all run containerized applications. Of those, a small number are running applications that manage the cluster. They are referred to as master nodes, also collectively known as the control plane.

*From the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane[Kubernetes Glossary]:* The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers.

=== Docker vs ContainerD

* `ctr` is a command-line client shipped as part of the containerd project. If you have containerd running on a machine, chances are the `ctr` binary is also present there. The `ctr` client is similar to Docker's eponymous CLI, but the commands and flags often differ from their (typically more user-friendly) docker analogs. Historically, the primary audience of the `ctr` client was containerd developers themselves testing the daemon. However, `ctr` can serve as a great exploration means - it operates right on top of the containerd API, and by examining the available commands, you can get a rough idea of what containerd can or cannot do.
* link:https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl[`nerdctl`] is a Docker-compatible CLI for link:https://containerd.io[containerd].
* `crictl` is a command-line interface for CRI-compatible container runtimes. You can use it to inspect and debug container runtimes and applications on a Kubernetes node. 

=== Recap Pods
Kubernetes does not deploy containers directly on the worker node. Containers are encapsulated in a Kubernetes objecet called pod. A pod is a single instance of an application. A pod is the smalles object that you can create in Kubernetes.

*Pods* usually have a 1-to-1 relationship with containers running the application. Scaling takes place through adding/removing pods.

*Multi-Container Pods* are possible but usually the containers inside the pod are not multiple containers of the same kind (= not the same image). Both containers share the lifecycle because they reside in the same Pod. They can communicate to each other via `localhost` since they share the same network space. They can also share the same storage space as well. But multi-container pods are a rare usecase.
