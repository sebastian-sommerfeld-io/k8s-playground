Expose the Dashboard app.

== Overview

Minikube has integrated support for the
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard[Kubernetes Dashboard UI]. The Dashboard is a
web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use it to:

* deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster
* troubleshoot your containerized application
* manage the cluster resources
* get an overview of applications running on your cluster
* creating or modifying individual Kubernetes resources (such as Deployments, Jobs, DaemonSets, etc)

For example, you can scale a Deployment, initiate a rolling update, restart a pod or deploy new
applications using a deploy wizard.

NOTE: This script is intended to run inside the Vagrantbox, so first connect with `vagrant ssh`.
Then navigate to `/vagrant/services` folder and run the script from there.
