Provisioning script for Vagrantbox to startup the docker compose ops stack inside the Vagrantbox.

== Overview

Startup the docker compose ops stack inside the Vagrantbox. The ops stack exposes
monitoring metrics and provices services to inspect the system.

CAUTION: This script is intended to run as part of the Vagrantbox provisioning. Do not run this
script directly! Other files are referenced with a path that only exists inside the Vagrantbox.
So running this script directly on your host would result in errors.

=== Script Arguments
