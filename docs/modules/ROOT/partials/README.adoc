== About this project
This project ist a local http://www.kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] installation for development purposes. It is running inside a virtual machine to avoid polluting the my development machine and to ensure portability. 

Note that for learning and development purposes, it is not necessary to install a full-blown Kubernetes cluster. Instead Minikube is used. Minikube is a lightweight alternative that allows developers to quickly set up a single-node Kubernetes cluster on their local machine.

Minikube provides many of the core features of Kubernetes, such as the ability to deploy and manage containers, and allows developers to experiment and learn about Kubernetes without the need for a full-scale production cluster. Additionally, Minikube is a great option for development because it allows developers to work on their applications in a Kubernetes environment without the need for a complex production infrastructure.

== How to use this project
CAUTION: Work in progess ...

. Install minikube and some tools like kubectl with `xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/src/main/provision/install-sh.adoc[src/main/provision/install.sh]`
. Startup minikube and the monitoring services with `xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/src/main/start-sh.adoc[src/main/start.sh]`
. Shutdown using `xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/src/main/stop-sh.adoc[src/main/stop.sh]`

=== Prerequisites
A docker installation is needed to run minikube. To run all services from this stack Docker 23.0.5 or greater is needed.
